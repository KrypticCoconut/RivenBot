*Rollback to first commit for the boilerplate of this bot

boilerplate has a discord.py wrapper which has a layout that requires seperate files for the main cog class and all the other commands to increase code neatness, sql caching using sqlalchemy + marshmallow, predefined decorators to setup Cog routines and control them, and a logger that is used by pretty much everything else, all the modules (the logger and sql cache currently) are set by config.json

Goodluck understanding my code, you dont really need to understand anything, copy paste everything except cogs and learn the usage for the cogs.

If you're really interested and want to use this (which isnt very hard if you read the cogs), you can contact me on krypt#4387 and i can explain :D
